# NAP - Client control for ISPs


Este repositorio esta destinado a el desarrollo del proyecto para la materia de POO

I have the idea of ​​creating a system that can manage client connections with network access points.
With OOP approach I have the idea of ​​creating a system that can manage client connections with network access points. Inheritance can be applied with client types, NAP or connection type.

A status report on client connections can be included in the program. Likewise, a service outage simulation can be created due to failure to detect the client and access point that is failing. It would not have a graphical interface at the moment.

I think it's interesting because there is only one platform on the market that does graph logging work and it has a lot of flaws. I think it can be useful for ISPs who want to manage their network in a more efficient and simple way.
